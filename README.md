# Module 04 - AI Finance App

For Module 04, I first explored the dataset from **Machine Learning Group - ULB** *Credit Card Fraud Detection* available via Kaggle on Google Colab. After performing data exploration and creating visualizations, I experimented with training several models using the processed data, determining that `XGBoost` performed best at detecting fraud and minimizing false positives. I then saved the model using `joblib()`. Next, I created this repository to house the saved model file, a requirements.txt, and the code for a simple UI created with Streamlit (see examples below).

Testing the application:
